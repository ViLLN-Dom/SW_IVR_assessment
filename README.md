Utilize SignalWire's resources to demonstrate your coding knowledge! An IVR (interactive voice response) is a telephony business staple that you are probably very familiar with.
"Thanks for calling XYZ..press 1 to talk to support, press 2 to talk to sales, or press 3 to record a voicemail." Use any of the SignalWire SDKs to build a basic IVR application that does all of the following:
Handle inbound calls to a SignalWire number
Play a short menu to the caller, offering them at least two menu options that will accept input and perform an action based on the caller's input (i.e., record voicemail, forward a call, gather customer information, etc.)  

IVR is active and has been tested; however, due to my trial status, only verified numbers can call the test number.
